# **Caltech101 Dataset Image Classification**

This project involves the classification of images from the **Caltech101** dataset using TensorFlow. The dataset contains 102 object categories, and the goal is to classify images into one of these 102 classes. The model is trained using Keras and TensorFlow, with multiple formats for saving the trained model, including `.h5`, **Keras**, **SavedModel**, **TensorFlow.js (TFJS)**, and **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)**.

### **Model Architecture and Training**
The model was trained on the **Caltech101** dataset, which consists of 102 categories of images. The system achieved excellent performance during training and evaluation:

- **Training Results**:
  - **Loss**: 0.05283
  - **Accuracy**: 99.1%

- **Testing Results**:
  - **Loss**: 0.60652
  - **Accuracy**: 86.5%

- **Validation Results**:
  - **Loss**: 0.6075
  - **Accuracy**: 87.3%

The model uses InceptionResNetV2 (a CNN) for transfer learning. It removes the top layers, applies Global Average Pooling, and adds a Dense layer with softmax for 102-class classification. ðŸš€

### **Model Saving Formats**

The trained model can be saved and used in different formats for easy deployment:

1. **.h5** (Keras Model)
   - The model is saved as a `.h5` file, which is compatible with Keras for future training and inference.
   
2. **TensorFlow SavedModel**
   - The model is saved in the TensorFlow **SavedModel** format, which is the default TensorFlow format for saving models and can be used for inference or further training.

3. **TensorFlow.js (TFJS)**
   - The trained model is also converted into the **TensorFlow.js (TFJS)** format, allowing you to run predictions in the browser or in Node.js.

4. **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)**
   - The model is converted to the **TensorFlow Lite** format, optimized for running on mobile and embedded devices with efficient resource usage.

### **Results**
After training, the model achieved the following performance on the **Caltech101** dataset:

- **Training Accuracy**: 99.1%
- **Testing Accuracy**: 86.5%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 87.3%

This high training accuracy suggests that the model generalizes well to the training data, while the testing and validation results indicate that the model still performs well on unseen data.
